      <h1>Café Luitpold</h1>
      <p>
        When one writes about restaurants, it's usually about the food,
        ambiance, and service. If the combination is good, the place gets
        recommended. If not, you go somewhere else. But some cafés are beyond
        that, and Café Luitpold is one of them. Even if they start serving
        instant coffee and hot dogs, you'd still have to go. This is not to say
        you should expect to be dissappointed: the restaurant has been in the
        Michelin Guide for years and is famous for its pastry and pralines. But
        I'll leave the food and coffee for you to judge and serve a bit of
        history instead.

        It's 1888. Prince-regent Luitpold is in power. Munich blooms. Later
        people would remember this period as the good old times. First image
        that the cafe looked like this: The location can hold 2000 people –
        astonishing number even for today. Several halls. Newspaper devotes a
        page to the grand opening calling the place a coffee palace.
