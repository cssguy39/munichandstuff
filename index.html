      <h1>Café Luitpold</h1>
      <p>
        When one writes about restaurants, it's usually about the food,
        ambiance, and service. If the combination is good, the place gets
        recommended. If not, you go somewhere else. But some cafés are beyond
        that, and Café Luitpold is one of them. Even if they start serving
        instant coffee and hot dogs, you'd still have to go. This is not to say
        you should expect to be dissappointed: the restaurant has been on
        Michelean list and is famous for its pastry and pralines. But I'll leave
        the food and coffee for you to judge and serve a bit of history instead.

        It's 1888. Prince-regent Luitpold is in power. Munich blooms. Later
        people would remember this period as the good old times. First image
        that the cafe looked like this: The location can it 2000 - astonishing
        number even for today. Several halls. Newspaper devotes a page to
        calling the place a coffee palace.
